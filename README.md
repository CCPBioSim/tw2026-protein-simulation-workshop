This workshop source repository contains the build recipe for a docker container derived from the CCPBioSim JupyterHub image. This container adds the necessary software packages and notebook content to form a deployable course container.

Though Python is a very popular and powerful environment for Biomolecular Simulation, many important and well-established tools require working from the command line in a terminal window. So it's an advantage to be familiar and comfortable with both ways of working. 
 
This workshop demonstrates two approaches to running MD simulations on a simple protein system:

1. From the command line in a terminal window, using [AMBER](http://ambermd.org)
2. In Python, via a Jupter Notebook, using [OpenMM](http://openmm.org)

The focus is on the preliminary simulations that are required to relax and equiliobrate an initially-built system, so that later "production" simulations have the best chance of being stable and reliable.


## How to Use

This training course is deployed on the [CCPBioSim](www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk) website via our cloud infrastructure, however you can deploy on your own machine with docker.

Pull the container from our repository::

    docker pull ghcr.io/ccpbiosim/protein-simulation-workshop:latest

In our containers we are using the JupyterHub default port 8888, so you should
forward this port when deploying locally::

    docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/ccpbiosim/protein-simulation-workshop:latest
